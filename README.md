# U7-SVG-Animated-Line-Drawing
 
1. Creating an Animated Line Drawing - Using SVG stroke properties and CSS, you can create an animation that moves a stroke along its path. The animation makes it look like the stroke is drawing itself. Once you understand how SVG line animation works, creating your own animated line drawing will be simple.
2. Animating stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset - I will learn how to use the stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset properties to create line animations.
    - Add a stroke to the path.
    - Set stroke-dasharray equal to paths total length.
    - Set stroke-dashoffset the same as stroke-dasharray.
    - Animate stroke-array to 0.
